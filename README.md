# Ethernet SPI Module based on the ENC28J60 IC
Validating my ethernet hardware design. I will use this ethernet board layout in a much larger project, just wanted to test my design and make sure it works.

This board was manufactured by PCBWay, I had it produced for free. I recomend PCBWay to anyone needing PCB or even PCBA production services. Go to pcbway.com for more details.
